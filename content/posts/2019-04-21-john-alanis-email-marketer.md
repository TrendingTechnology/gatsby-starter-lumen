1)Self-intro



John Alanis, from Austin, Texas. Been in direct marketing since 1996, internet marketing since 2000 (when GoTo.com invented ppc and Google “stole” it).

I used to focus on dating, but now focus on what is more accurately called the “horny guy” business, since there is an enormous amount of horny guy traffic out there and always will be. This is best described as “casual dating” and not “adult.” I’m a list builder (email and now push) so I focus on all types of traffic that can be funneled to an opt in page to generate an email list I can market to over and over - banner, push, email, tab, text link, etc.



2)Changes in traffic types / verticals from last year?



As expected, push has dropped off a bit (as happens with all “new media”) but is still a very viable way to both buy traffic, and for building a list of push notification subscribers to market to. I would say it’s pretty close to what it will be over the long term, although google can always fart and make it go away. It’s an add-on to an affiliate marketing business, not something to base a business on.



3)Blackhat vs . Whitehat?



I personally always go white hat because it allows me to form long term relationships with offer owners, traffic sources, etc. Those who go black hat spend their time staying one step ahead of “the law” and see huge dips and spikes in their business. Yes, some are very good at it, love the game and can make it work, but I have always personally preferred running clean and it has served me well when I’ve had a problem or an issue that invariably crops up in affiliate marketing.



4)Which traffic types / verticals are thriving/dying?



The “horny guy” business has been around since long before the invention of the internet (I hear a guy named Hugh Hefner made a fortune from it), and will continue to be around. Email will be steady as ever (opt in email, spamming is harder than ever I think, but I don’t fool around with that, so

others will have to weigh in), and I believe push will continue to diminish but be a viable add on to partially offset traffic cost (like, say, happened with Adsense circa 2006 or so) and banners will continue to be solid, especially on mobile.



5)Which traffic source/type and vertical if starting this year?



I’d keep doing what I’m doing now, the “horny guy” business, building lists and selling the original click over and over, instead of just once.



So, a few things that were reinforced in 2019 that have been true ever since Corey Rudl came out with cartips.com and marketingtips.com and told everyone that Mailloop really, really, really was a good piece of software and worked (Corey was a great guy, a true pioneer, and someone I considered a friend, but Mailloop was a turd and did NOT work).



In order to make real money in affiliate marketing, you have to come out from behind the computer and meet the people you do business with in person. You have to go to the events, talk to vendors, keep your ear to the ground, form relationships, understand everyone is out to get your money, and keep your finger on the pulse of this business - the rate of change is faster than ever. Forming relationships in person will bring you a measure of stability in business, and allow you to identify opportunity before others do.

Buy a few drinks, pick up a few dinner tabs, talk with a lot of people, identify the real players and the bullshit artists, and form lasting relationships with those few who know what the hell they are doing.



Always test small, then slowly expand, letting the media prove itself, letting the offer owners get comfortable with you and the traffic. Understand that traffic sources will always die, offers will always pause, and others will seek to rip your banners and landers (but never your relationship with your email list - that’s work.)



Think in terms of “bridging the gap.” I.e. if you have an offer that is converting but at a loss, think of all the things you can do to offset traffic cost - selling banners and exit traffic on your landing page, selling CPC text links, email blasts to your list, etc. Use every part of the pig, all you need is one part of your campaign to be profitable while the rest offset traffic cost and you can do very well.







Also, especially for you younger people (I am 48), familiarize yourself with the magic of compound interest. A business is something to get money out of, not put money into, and if you can get a lot of money out of your business into secure investments (I happen to like the Motley Fool mutual funds), you can be set for life. There’s an old saying that rich people buy assets, poor people buy liabilities, and that’s true. A big Cock-Knocker watch to show off to others who are showing off is a liability, as is “bottle service” where you pay $800

for a bottle of nasty-ass Jim Beam White Label to drink on the other side of a velvet rope (google “compound interest calculator” and see how that $800 can grow over time). Don’t get me wrong, I am all for having a good time, and I detest cheap people, but if you don’t get money out of your business and into investments where it can safely grow, you will soon find yourself without any when your business takes a dip (and all businesses do).



So, as always in the affiliate marketing business circa 2019, everything has changed and everything has stayed the same.
